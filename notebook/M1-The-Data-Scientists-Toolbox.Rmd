#  (PART) The Data Scientists Toolbox {-}  

#  Getting Started {#module1} 


In this module, one is introduced to the basics of what data science is, some of topics discussed are: types of data, the job of the data scientist, and the process needed in order to cure data and information into usable knowledge. It also has a practical component, introducing you to one important tool at the data scientist disposal, the [R language](www.r-project.org) and it's IDE [Rstudio](rstudio.com). The subject of version control is also addressed and the basics of git and github are explore. The lectures where made following the spirit of reproducible work and R potential use for automation the material consisted of written lectures and videos made completely autonomous extracting the information of the written material and putting it in video format. This stroke my curiosity, they were far from perfect, but it displayed a practical application of what can be done with R.


One of the pieces of content that strike me as meaningful was at the introduction, answering the question why we need data science: 

> One of the reasons for the rise of data science in recent years is the vast amount of data currently available and being generated. Not only are massive amounts of data being collected about many aspects of the world and our lives,but we simultaneously have the rise of inexpensive computing. This has created the perfect storm in which we have rich data and the tools to analyze it, rising computer memory capabilities, better processors, more software and now, more data scientists with the skills to put this to use and answer questions using this data. 




## final assessment 

As part of the final assessment one needs to demonstrate that has successfully set up a  R installation with a working Rstudio. for me both installations went flawless and Rstudio detected the R program without any configuration issues.

One also need to demonstrate the creation of a github account mine can be found as [jsduenass](https://github.com/jsduenass/). 

create a [markdown file](https://github.com/jsduenass/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/HelloWorld.md)

and make a fork from jtleek's  [How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jsduenass/datasharing)


I found interesting the peer review methodology used in this final assignment that encourage students participate and interact.
