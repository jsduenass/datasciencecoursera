## Project structure
These project was made using Rmarkdown and the bookdown package. It is organized in three main parts code, data and notebook. code holds the scripts made and notebook holds the documentation itself.

The book is build using the Rstudio "Build Book Tool" where the output goes to the untracked ```deploy``` directory. This directory holds all the content and is uploaded to the gh-branch.
